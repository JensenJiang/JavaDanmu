This is a clone to [gdanmaku-server](https://github.com/tuna/gdanmaku-server) and [danmaQ](https://github.com/bigeagle/danmaQ), rewritten in Java.

## What is Danmaku?

Danmaku (Japanese: 弾幕, Chinese: 弹幕, English: bullet hell), is an ACG (Animation, Comic and Game) culture in East Asia, especially in Japan and China. It is so called because of the barrage-like moving subtitles over the screen.
